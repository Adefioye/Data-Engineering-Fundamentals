    "Data modeling is a process to support both your business and your user applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "LOgical modelling is process of mapping conceptual data models to logical models using the concept of schema, columns and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical data modelling has to do with the transformation of logical data models to databases DDL. This allows for the creation of physical tables, schemas and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational databse is a digital database based on the relational model(this is a model that organizes data in rows and columns). RDBMS is the software system used to maintain relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database/schema is a collection of tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables/relation is a group of rows with the same labelled elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns/attributes are labelled elements of a table.\n",

    "- Ease of use \n",
    "- Ability to do JOINS \n",
    "- Ability to do aggregations and analytics\n",
    "- Smaller data volumes\n",
    "- Easier to change business requirements(this happens through the ease of ad hoc queries)\n",

    "- Modeling the data not modeling queries\n",
    "- Allows for the use of secondary indexes\n",

    "\n",
    "**Atomicity**, the whole transaction is processed or nothing is processed at all.\n",
    "**Consistency**, means only transactions that abide by rules and constraints are written into a database otherwise database keeps previous state. \n",
    "**Isolation**, means transactions are processed independently and securely, order does not matter.\n",
    "**Durability** means completed transactions are saved in the database even in event of system failure."
